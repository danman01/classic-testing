<h3>Rails - RSPEC and Factory Girl</h3>

<p>Building on last week (using test driven development with Ruby and RSpec
outside of a rails application). The goal this week is to incorporate TDD inside a Rails
application, which entails using <a href="https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/">RSpec</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails">Factory Girl Rails</a></p>

<p>What is Factory Girl and what is it's purpose (See
<a href="https://github.com/danman01/classic-testing">last week</a>
for a brief description of RSpec)? Taken from 
<a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails">Factory GirlRails github
page</a>, Factory girl is: </p>

<p><i>a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition 
syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved 
instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple 
factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), 
including factory inheritance.</i>. </p>

</p>Uhhhh..Ok... What if wee are not familiar with fixtures and the
rest of what that description means, then a good place to start is 
[Rails Guides - Testing](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html), 
(by the way you should read the Rails Guids on testing now if you have not
already done so). What are <i>Fixtures</i>? Taken directly from Rails Guides:</p>

  <p><i>Fixtures is a fancy word for sample data. Fixtures allow you to populate 
  your testing database with predefined data before your tests run. Fixtures 
  are database independent and assume a single format: YAML.</p>

<p>That is a bit more palatable. Back to <i>Factory Girl</i>. What is
Factory Girl in laymans terms (as layman as it gets, maybe)? From the 
makers of <i>Factory Girl</i>:</p>

***** Discussion Point *****
<p>What are other differences/advantages/disadvantages are there between <i>Factory
Girl</i> and <i>Fixtures</i>?</p>
*****

<p>In order to use RSpec and Factory Girl (both gems) inside a rails a little setup is required</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Gemfile</b>:
<p>Make sure the correct gems are installed for the correct environments (test,
development).</p>
``` ruby
group :test, :development do
  gem "rspec-rails", "~> 2.0"
  gem 'factory_girl_rails'
end
```

```RSpec``` needs to be in the ```:development group```.
</li>
<li>Update gems in Gemfile: ```bundle install```</li>
<li> Run ```rails generate rspec:install``` 
  <ul>
    <li>This adds the spec directory and some skeleton files<li>
    <li>The "rake spec"</li>
    <li>``spec_helper.rb``` (configurations for RSpec)</li>
    <li>```.rspec``` (configurations for RSpec output to screen, i.e. color)</li>
    <li> and some other files </li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li></li>
</ol>
