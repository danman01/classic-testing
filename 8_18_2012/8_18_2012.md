<h3>Rails - RSPEC and FactoryGirl</h3>

<p>Building on last week's work (using test driven development with Ruby and RSpec
outside of a rails application). The goal this week is to incorporate TDD inside a Rails
application, which entails using [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails/) and [FactoryGirl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails).</p>

<p>What is FactoryGirl and what is it's purpose? (See
[last week's project](https://github.com/danman01/classic-testing) for a brief 
description of RSpec)). Taken from [factory_girl_rails github
page](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails),
Factory girl is: </p>

<p><i>a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition 
syntax, support for multiple build strategies (saved instances, unsaved 
instances, attribute hashes, and stubbed objects), and support for multiple 
factories for the same class (user, admin_user, and so on), 
including factory inheritance.</i>. </p>

</p>Uhhhh..Ok... So, assuming we are not familiar with testing, what are 
fixtures and the rest of that description? According to [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html), 
(by the way you should read the Rails Guids on testing now if you have not
already done so) Fixtures are:</p>

<p><i>Fixtures is a fancy word for sample data. Fixtures allow you to populate 
your testing database with predefined data before your tests run. Fixtures 
are database independent and assume a single format: YAML.</p>

<p>That is a bit more palatable. Then, back to <i>FactoryGirl</i> What is
FactoryGirl in laymans terms (as layman as it gets, maybe):</p>

<p>In order to use RSpec and FactoryGirl (both gems) inside a rails a little setup is required</p>
